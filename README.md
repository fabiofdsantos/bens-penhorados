Capstone project of the bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering granted by the Polytechnic Institute of Leiria, in the 2014-15 academic year.

The project consisted in the development of a web application that aims to references the seized items by Autoridade Tributária.
In order to provide a “user-friendly” experience, this application was built to solve the problems identified in the current state of the art (e.g. by simplifying search tasks).
